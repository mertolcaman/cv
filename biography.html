        <p>
            &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I was born in 1996 in Manisa, Turkey. Before starting primary school I had
            already learnt both reading and writing thanks to my elder sister’s books and her effort. When I started the
            primary school, I was considered to promote to 2.class without taking education from first level, yet I
            didn’t accept it so that I could see all the educational phase.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            After starting high school named “Hasan Turek Anatolian High School”, I continued to learn guitar through
            internet by myself, which I had already taken couple of basic lessons from municipality course center. Then,
            I learnt classical guitar followed by bass guitar from internet. In this way, I was bassist in the school
            band and took part in different events related to school and municipality as well as 2 competitions named
            “Vodafone Freezone High School Music Competition” in 2014 and 2015 respectively. I didn’t study much until
            the last year of the high school. Nevertheless, I took honour certificate in the last year thanks to my hard
            work. Additionally, I took better result than most of my friends did from the university entrance exam in
            2015 (I was nearly 70 000 out of 1,944,933 candidates, which corresponds 3.56% of total.).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Then I moved to Bursa where I studied in the department of mechanical engineering at “Bursa Uludag
            University”. After taking 1-year-mandatory-English-preparation class, I started to study in my own
            department. I couldn’t pass 2 of my lectures in the first final exam of the first semester (one was related
            to history, another was “Calculus-I”), due to the fact that I don’t like history and I was late for
            calculus. However, I passed both after taking second chance for final exams. Even so, I passed “Basic
            Physics-I”, a lecture in which more than %90 of the students who took it in the same year as me couldn’t
            pass even after taking the second chance of the final exams. In the second term of the first year, I passed
            all of my lectures by being in the first 10% of my department. Hence, “honor certificate” was given to me.
            In the meantime, I helped some of my friends by teaching them “C++”, the subject which helped me to
            understand that I like coding, and “MATLAB”, and “Calculus” and “Physics”.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The first term of the second year followed the same by being in the first 10%, yet we were only 5 in the
            list because of being hard and I got my second “honor certificate”. Meanwhile, I found some friends whom I
            could make music with. Then we started to perform cover of many songs in not only events of couple of events
            relevant to university but also private places. Afterwards, I got “higher honor certificate” in the second
            term, since my GPA of the term was 3.75. I had already planned to study at a university which has better
            conditions by the middle of the year, so I applied for a programme called “Farabi Student Exchange
            Programme”, which includes the universities situated in my own country and candidates were chosen among the
            students from all of the universities in Turkey.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I was accepted to the programme and I studied at “Yıldız Technical University” located in Istanbul for a
            year. During my education period in Istanbul, I was aware of that everything depended on a student and it
            wasn’t related to which university I was studying. I was successful in that university, too and passed all
            of the exams at the first trying, in spite of many students who took some of the exams twice. Besides the
            lectures, I attended a seminar called “BEMDAYS”, which was arranged by a student club called “MAKTEK” in
            March-2019, which covered various topics from different speakers who worked in different industries from
            NASA to Toyota. One of the speaker was “Onat ATAYER”, who graduated from the same university as I continued
            the exchange programme and who was working in “Microsoft”, and his presentation was related to “Data
            Science” and how the works will be shaped in the future. I was impressed after learning unordinary
            knowledges concerned with data and data era.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            By the time when I completed my education in Istanbul, I had already applied for my second exchange
            programme called “Erasmus Student Exchange Programme” and I was the second student among the other ones in
            my department who applied for the same programme in the same term, so my first choice was accepted.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my third year, I moved to Poland in order to study at “Silesian University of Technology” located in
            Gliwice, Poland. My main aim in the programme was to learn the cultures in different countries and seeing
            the differences by observing, so I travelled 15 different countries located in around Poland. That’s why I
            couldn’t pass 3 of my lectures in that time. Probably I would do the same thing, if I had chance to go back
            those times.
        </p>

        <p>
            Just before completing my education in Poland, Coronavirus had already broken out and spread out many
            countries, but I was able to come back to my country without any restriction. In fact, I went to Bursa to
            continue the education in my home university, but a declaration that universities would give a break for
            education was announced by ministry. I had to come back to my hometown, Manisa.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I learnt Arduino and implemented many projects (such as Bluetooth controlled home-made electrical vehicle,
            and the controlling of servo motor through RF-module, and more) during pandemic, besides my university
            lectures. My education continued as remote. At the meantime, I took some courses related to “SolidWorks”,
            and “Advanced Excel” from “Elginkan Foundation”. Also, I bought a “3D printer”. I worked on that by fixing
            the printing problems and creating designs through “SolidWorks”. Next year, I did my final project in which
            the subject was specified by me related to “Designing of Quadcopter and Controlling by Arduino-MATLAB”. I
            worked on my final project for a semester. During the project, data which came from sensor was the hardest
            part due to being noisy. In spite of adding “kalman filter” and some materials which absorbed the vibration,
            it was still problem up to a point. In fact, it was more problematic than PID, even though it looked
            something simple, so I got the importance of managing data as I desired.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I couldn’t graduate from the university after finishing all of the lectures that I had to take. Because I
            didn’t complete my mandatory internship entirely. Then I was accepted as a part time manufacturing engineer
            by a company where metal parts were produced after the processes of either laser or punch cutting followed
            by bending machines. It was 6-month period for the first part and it was extended. While I was working in
            there, I took part in different units of the factory and I mainly thought about improvements that could be
            performed in order to eliminate the situation which created loss of efficiency by observing operators for
            weeks. Moreover, there was a system which took data from workers’ operations, interacting with “Power BI”.
            From time to time, I transferred relevant data in order to use in “Excel” and match with my observation
            notes and make up better decisions by creating different charts (bar, line, pie) based on operator, machine,
            shift. After these point, I comprehended the importance of the data completely and humanity is at the just
            beginning of it relatively. I took some basic-level courses related to “Data Science and Introduction to AI”
            and “Data Literacy” from the educational platform of “Turkcell” called “Geleceği Yazanlar”.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Then I decided to learn the aforementioned subject thoroughly at all costs, but there were a few people who
            know this field in my country, so I had to learn it abroad and the first thing that I needed to do was
            taking IELTS. I quit the job so that I could find more time to study for the exam. In this way, I would be
            able to study at the universities from all over the world. Occasionally, I took short-period courses from
            “Global AI Hub”, which helped me to meet with “Kaggle”, for “data visualization”, “data analysis” as well as
            that of long-period ones such as “Python”, and “SQL” from “Elginkan Foundation” and I searched frequently
            about data science from different sources in order to draw a path to learn. I kept on taking information
            from internet. Finally, I took 6.5 from IELTS on October and then, I thought that it would be better
            studying for “statistics”. I found the lecture notes of “Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)” and
            started to study for them. Also, I watched almost all of the videos about statistical methods used in
            machine learning algorithms, created by Sadi Evren ŞEKER (an eminent professor in this field mainly). In the
            meantime, I started to learn from Kaggle and. Still, I am making progress day by day.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I started to study at the university of Sussex on September,2023. I have learnt new information, while I
            have found many opportunities to review my knowledge in different sub-subjects of data science such as
            statistics, and programming. Furthermore, we have been dealing with statistics, NLP, some libraries in
            python, hypothesis testing by projects, and quizzes. I started to feel like a data scientist thanks to
            these.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Up to now, I think I am someone who can learn anything that I am interested in by myself, but I need to be
            boosted in this field for being ready in a shorter time, so I need professional help and need to figure out
            the fundamental of this subject completely. I am looking forward the days when I am ready for implementing
            new projects created by myself and convey my knowledge for the next generation. I am cut out for this field,
            since I really like to reveal something new that many people can’t do on computer by using various tools.
            Data collected from a large group of sources are getting increase and some people are needed to handle with
            it in the science of the data.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            I graduated from the University of Sussex in 2024 with an MSc in Data Science. During my time there, I
            developed a strong foundation in statistical reasoning, machine learning, and natural language processing. I
            worked on diverse projects that helped me practice and reinforce Python programming, hypothesis testing, and
            working with real-world datasets in various formats, including tabular, text, and time-series data.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            At university, I explored multiple applied areas of data science. I used LLMs and LSTM networks to analyze
            social media sentiment and forecast cryptocurrency price movements - which gave me insights into
            time-dependent modeling and the power of language models. In another project, I forecasted crop export
            values using neural networks trained on FAOSTAT agricultural data. I built models for propaganda detection
            using both bag-of-words and BERT, and experimented with image processing in MATLAB, working on tasks such as
            noise removal, rotation, and shape detection. I also applied machine learning models like Naïve Bayes and
            word-list classifiers to sentiment analysis tasks and explored activity prediction using sensor-based
            datasets. These experiences gave me solid exposure to key concepts like feature engineering, model
            evaluation, and working across multiple domains.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            After graduating, I moved directly into project-based and professional roles that allowed me to apply what
            I’d learned - and push far beyond it. One of my first personal data science projects involved SQL-based
            revenue and conversion analysis, where I categorized acquisition channels and predicted customer churn and
            lifetime value (LTV) using Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM models. This gave me a clear understanding of
            customer analytics, cohort analysis, and how machine learning connects to product decisions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Soon after, I developed a fully functional AI-powered chatbot that retains conversation context, supports
            user authentication, and dynamically retrieves past chat history - combining React, FastAPI, Firestore, and
            cloud deployment on Dockerized infrastructure. This not only helped me solidify my full-stack development
            skills, but also deepened my interest in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and building smarter natural
            language interfaces.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Professionally, I began working as a Data Scientist at an Agricultural IoT Startup, where I’ve led the
            development of a cloud-native data pipeline and visualization system. I set up AWS IoT Core to ingest sensor
            data, created secure APIs using FastAPI, and designed an intuitive frontend with React.js to display
            real-time agricultural metrics. I implemented CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, deployed services with
            Docker, and configured EC2 instances with Nginx for full-stack integration. I also built monitoring systems
            using Lambda functions and SNS alerts, ensuring system reliability and timely anomaly detection.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            To continue expanding my capabilities, I joined the Patika.dev & NewMind AI Bootcamp, where I’m currently
            exploring Neo4j, Cypher queries, and graph-powered retrieval systems. I’m particularly interested in
            combining vector embeddings with knowledge graphs to enable semantically rich AI assistants that reason over
            structured relationships, not just text similarity.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I believe I am someone who thrives in solving interdisciplinary problems - blending AI, cloud systems, data
            modeling, and full-stack thinking. I enjoy building tools that help people better interact with their data
            and make more informed decisions. As our world becomes increasingly data-driven, I’m excited to be among
            those designing how we interface with that data - not just through charts and code, but through intelligent,
            responsive systems.
